# LincsLab Projects repository

Welcome guys to our beloved  **[LincsLab](https://lincslab.ca/)** private repository. 

This repository serves as a centralized platform for storing the code and documentation for the various projects we are implicated in. The repository is structured to facilitate easy access, organization, and collaboration among ourselves, ensuring that all the projects code is readily available for further research, development, and publication purposes. 

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders for each team member, with subfolders for each project worked on.

```

├── Member2/

└── Member3/

    └── ProjectY/

## Responsibilities of each member

- **Code Submission**: We are expected to upload the code for each project we work on. For every project submission (for publications or presentations), the respective code should be updated in this repository. If multiple members have collaborated or collaborate on a project, it’s efficient for one member to upload the code and clearly specify the contributions of all team members.
- **Documentation**: Please include a `README.md` file in each project folder that describes the project, setup instructions, and any dependencies required.
- **Regular Updates**: Ensure the code is updated as changes are made to reflect the latest versions used in publications or presentations.


## Documentation requirements

For consistency and clarity, each project folder should contain:

- A `README.md` file outlining:
  - **Project Overview**: A brief description of the project's objectives and scope.
  - **Installation**: Steps to set up the codebase locally.
  - **Usage**: Basic instructions on how to run the code.
  - **Dependencies**: Any required libraries (or version of libraries) or tools.
  - **Contributors**: List of team members contributing to the project.

- **Additional Documentation** (if necessary): For complex projects, include additional files, such as diagrams or detailed explanations, to help other members understand the project better.
